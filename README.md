- ðŸ“« How to reach me: piotr.w.dabrowski2@gmail.com

- ðŸ’ª Proud: I wrote in python: saper, Tic Tac Toe, chess and a program for automatic creation of emails. The program creates properly filled diplomas (file.docx) and properly filled emails with attachments in the form of diplomas for each line. User clicks excel button to run program (thanks to vba).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I quit my well-paying job because I felt a huge need to automate repetitive tasks. In my dream job, I only care about the possibility of developing my programming skills. My financial liquidity allows me not to work for a very long time.
